In addition to the EVF, a 3.0\" 2.36m-dot rear LCD with a touch panel design is provided for simple operation and focusing adjustment. In addition, the screen tilts upward 107\u00b0 and downward 41\u00b0 to facilitate working from high and low angles. While staying lightweight, the magnesium alloy chassis ensures stiffness, longevity, and stability. The lens attachment has also been modified to help accommodate heavier lenses, as has the grip stiffness for more comfortable hand-holding. Extensive weather-sealing has been used to withstand dust and moisture for dependable operation in extreme weather situations, including increased sealing around the battery cover, terminal cover, and chassis joints. The a7R IVA's battery life is rated at roughly 530 shots per charge with the EVF or 660 shots with the rear LCD, using the same NP-FZ100 battery as its predecessor. Dual SD memory card slots provide versatile file storage and processing, and may be set to divide raw and JPEG files or to record overflow data. Both of the card slots are rated to support UHS-II memory cards for faster transfer speeds. Integrated PC sync terminal for wired flash sync with strobe packs or wireless radio remotes. A USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C port has been added, in addition to a micro-USB port, for faster, more reliable tethering support. The USB Type-C connection allows the camera to be charged from the host power source while connected. Updated Multi Interface Shoe supports working with the optional ECM-B1M Shotgun Microphone or XLR-K3M XLR Adapter Kit, which provide improved, clear audio recording sound by sending a digital audio signal to the camera, opposed to an analog signal. In addition, the a7R IVA has a 3.5mm microphone input connector for use with external microphones. The a7R IVA's built-in Wi-Fi allows it to rapidly transmit imagery to mobile devices for direct sharing online to social networking sites, via email, and cloud storage services. Wireless tethered shooting is also possible with support for both the 2.4 and 5.0 GHz bands. NFC (Near Field Communication) is also available, allowing for a one-touch connection between the camera and compatible mobile devices with no complicated setup. When connected, the linked mobile device may also display a live view image on its screen and activate the shutter of the camera remotely.",
